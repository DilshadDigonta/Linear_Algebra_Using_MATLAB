# Linear_Algebra_Using_MATLAB
Linear algebra has various numerical Solution method. We can use  MATLAB codes to find a few of the solutions. I have tried to wirte a few solution codes using  the help of youtube tutorial, lecture of my Professor, and class mates. 
There are 5 methods here for linear algebra solving 
gauss-elimination, gauss-jordan, jacobi iteration, gauss-siedel and SOR.
hope this is helpful and enjoy
